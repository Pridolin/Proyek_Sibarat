As beginners, it can be hard to start learning sign language. So how can we help the newcomers in learning sign language? We want to create an application that helps newcomers and people that are interested in sign language in general with an app that translates pictures of hand signs into alphabets. SIBARAT is an Android application that can translate sign language into alphabets using the American Sign Language as its base. The app uses a machine learning model to detect specific hand sign using MNIST Dataset with CNN. The tools used for the CC are Node.js, Hapijs, Tensorflow js, and Docker. Resources used are Cloud Storage, Cloud Run, Firestore, adn Artifact Registry. The app is build on Kotlin using Android Studio using MVVM as the architecture.

Tools:
Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
- Android Studio: Android app development.
- Visual Studio Code : for devise files like  source codes  in general
- UI/UX Development:
- Figma: UI wireframe and prototype.

Programming Languages:
- Kotlin: Primary language for Android app development.
- Python: for AI and machine learning components.

Machine Learning and AI Libraries:
- TensorFlow : for implementing AI algorithms and models for sign language recognition and translation.

Cloud Computing Services:
Google Cloud Platform (GCP): for cloud infrastructure, storage, and machine learning resources. For infrastructure, GCP uses services like Cloud Run and Compute Engine. Cloud Run allows you to run applications without managing servers, while Compute Engine provides customizable virtual machines. For storage, GCP uses Google Cloud Storage, which offers scalable and secure object storage. GCP also provides a range of tools and services for machine learning, including TensorFlow

Mobile App Development Libraries:
- Retrofit: API management in android
- Bumptech Glide: Load images into android
- Room: Local database
- TensorFlow Lite: Import machine learning into android.

Image Recognition and Text-to-Image APIs:
Google Cloud Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image APIs, or similar alternatives: for integrating image and text features.

Image Processing Libraries:
- OpenCV: for image processing and analysis.
- CNN:for image processing.

Version Control:
- Git platforms like GitHub : for collaborative coding and version control.

Project Management Tools:
- Docker : for project tracking and management.
- Communication and Collaboration Tools: Whatsapp, Google Meet, Google Collab, Google Docs

Documentation Tools:
- Microsoft Office, Google Docs, or Markdown editors: for creating project documentation and user guides.

Testing and Debugging Tools:
- Android Device/Emulator: Test mobile app features.
- Postman: Test API response.
